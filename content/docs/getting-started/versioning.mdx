# API Versioning

The EduCare API uses URL-based versioning to ensure backward compatibility while allowing us to evolve the API over time.

## Current Version

> **Current Version**: v1  
> **Base URL**: `https://api.educare.com/v1`

## Versioning Strategy

We include the version number in the URL path:

```
https://api.educare.com/v1/students
https://api.educare.com/v1/teachers
https://api.educare.com/v1/classes
```

## Version Lifecycle

| Stage | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Current** | Ongoing | Latest stable version, actively maintained |
| **Supported** | 12 months | Previous version, receives security updates |
| **Deprecated** | 6 months | Scheduled for removal, migration recommended |
| **Sunset** | - | No longer available |

## Deprecation Policy

When we deprecate an API version:

1. **Announcement**: 12 months before sunset
2. **Documentation**: Migration guides published
3. **Headers**: Deprecation warnings in responses
4. **Support**: Assistance available during transition

### Deprecation Headers

Deprecated endpoints include warning headers:

```http
Deprecation: true
Sunset: Sat, 31 Dec 2026 23:59:59 GMT
Link: <https://api.educare.com/v2/students>; rel="successor-version"
```

## Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes

### Non-Breaking Changes (No Version Bump)

These changes are backward compatible:

- Adding new endpoints
- Adding optional request parameters
- Adding new fields to responses
- Adding new enum values
- Improving error messages

### Breaking Changes (New Version)

These changes require a new version:

- Removing endpoints
- Removing or renaming response fields
- Changing field data types
- Modifying required parameters
- Changing authentication methods

## Migration Guide

When migrating between versions:

> **Tip**: We recommend testing the new version in a staging environment before updating production.

### Step 1: Review Changes

Check the changelog for breaking changes that affect your integration.

### Step 2: Update Base URL

```diff
- const BASE_URL = 'https://api.educare.com/v1';
+ const BASE_URL = 'https://api.educare.com/v2';
```

### Step 3: Test Thoroughly

- Run your test suite against the new version
- Verify all endpoints work as expected
- Check error handling still functions correctly

## Upcoming: v2

We're working on v2 of the EduCare API with exciting improvements:

- GraphQL support
- Real-time webhooks
- Enhanced filtering and sorting
- Batch operations

> ⚠️ v2 is currently in beta. Sign up at dashboard.educare.com for early access.
