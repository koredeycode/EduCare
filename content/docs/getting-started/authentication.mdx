# Authentication

The EduCare API uses **Bearer Token authentication** for all endpoints except the health check. You'll need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Getting Your API Key

1. **Create an Account**: Visit [dashboard.educare.com](https://dashboard.educare.com) and create a developer account.
2. **Generate API Key**: Navigate to **Settings → API Keys** and click "Generate New Key".
3. **Store Securely**: Copy your API key and store it securely. You won't be able to see it again!

> ⚠️ **Security Best Practice**: Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Always use environment variables.

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'JavaScript', 'Python', 'PHP']}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.educare.com/v1/students
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="JavaScript">
```javascript
fetch('https://api.educare.com/v1/students', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.educare.com/v1/students',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'}
)
print(response.json())
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="PHP">
```php
<?php
$ch = curl_init('https://api.educare.com/v1/students');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, [
    'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
echo $response;
?>
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authentication Errors

If your API key is invalid or missing, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key",
  "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "status": 401
}
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing `Bearer` prefix | Ensure the header is `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` (with space) |
| Expired key | Generate a new key from the dashboard |
| Wrong environment | Check if using production vs. sandbox key |
| Key revoked | Contact support if you believe this is an error |

## API Key Scopes

| Scope | Access Level |
|-------|--------------|
| `read:students` | Read student data |
| `write:students` | Create/update students |
| `read:teachers` | Read teacher data |
| `write:teachers` | Create/update teachers |
| `read:classes` | Read class data |
| `write:classes` | Create/update classes |
| `admin` | Full access to all resources |

> **Note**: Standard API keys include all scopes. Contact support for restricted scope keys.
