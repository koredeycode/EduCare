# Quick Start

Get started with the EduCare API in under 5 minutes. This guide walks you through making your first API request.

## Prerequisites

- An EduCare developer account ([Sign up](https://dashboard.educare.com))
- An API key from your dashboard
- A tool to make HTTP requests (cURL, Postman, or your code)

## Step 1: Verify API Access

First, test that you can reach the API using the health check endpoint (no authentication required):

```bash
curl https://api.educare.com/v1/health
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.educare.com/v1/health');
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
// { "status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0", ... }
```

**Python:**
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.educare.com/v1/health')
print(response.json())
# {'status': 'healthy', 'version': '1.0.0', ...}
```

## Step 2: Authenticate Your Request

Now make an authenticated request to list students:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.educare.com/v1/students
```

You should see a response like:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1234,
      "name": "Emma Wilson",
      "email": "emma.wilson@student.educare.com",
      "grade_level": "11"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20,
    "total": 150,
    "total_pages": 8
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Create a Resource

Create a new student record:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.educare.com/v1/students \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@student.educare.com",
    "grade_level": "10"
  }'
```

> **Success!** You've made your first API requests to EduCare.
